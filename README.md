## :books: How Firebase Database is Organized

### Authentication

With Firebase Authentication, theres 4 methods of Login/Signup:

- Email
- Google
- Anilist
- Anonymous
- <s>GitHub</s>

It is used to store on User Document things like:

- User Profile Photo
- Username
- Preferences (media source, adult content, subtitles and more)
- [DEPRECATED]Comments
- Notifications
- Bookmarked Medias
- Currently Watching Medias
- Episodes Watched
- Chapters Read

### Collections and Documents

With Firebase Database, we have 3 Collections:

#### Users

Stores only Users Documents after a successfull signup.

#### [DEPRECATED]Comments

Stores comments made on episodes or on its main page.

Its separated based on Anilist API Media IDs Documents, and after that, a Collection that holds all comments to this media and other related to a episode where that comment was made.

It strongly depends on Users Collection, due to each comment needs its user (owner). Each comment has a referer to its owner and stores its interactions, with Likes and Dislikes.

When a Comment is made, it saves sort of a log on User Document, with infos like interactions with other comment or written on a episode.

#### Notifications

The Notifications Collections stores a document for each Media ID related to Anilist API every time a user assigned himself to be notified about a new episode release.

Each document has a Collection that holds every user assigned to receive a notification.

In this document, has info of all episodes already notified to any user and the next to be notified, cover art, if is complete, status and last update date.

- User Document Relation: After a successfull notification is deliveried to user, it stores the last episode info on User Document, so it can be notified again and the next one is released.
